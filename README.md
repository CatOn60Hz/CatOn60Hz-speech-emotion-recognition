# Emotional Analysis Backend

**Emotional Analysis Backend** is a real-time backend system built to detect and analyze emotional states from audio input using machine learning and signal processing. Designed for performance, security, and scalability, it enables seamless integration with frontend applications and services via a robust API and WebSocket support.

---

## What It Does

- Real-time audio processing and emotional state detection  
- Machine learning-powered sentiment classification  
- WebSocket support for live feedback streams  
- Secure authentication with token-based access control  
- MongoDB-based data storage and user management  
- Interactive emotional trend visualization using Chart.js  

---

## Key Capabilities

### Real-Time Emotion Detection  
Audio input is processed and analyzed in real-time to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality.

### Scalable API Architecture  
RESTful endpoints for integrating emotion analytics into any application — mobile, web, or desktop.

### Live Feedback with WebSocket  
Supports WebSocket channels for streaming emotional responses during live sessions or voice input.

### Secure and Modular  
Includes user registration, login, and protected endpoints using JWT-based authentication.

### Data Insights and Visualization  
Stores historical emotion data and visualizes it with Chart.js, enabling trend analysis and behavioral understanding.
